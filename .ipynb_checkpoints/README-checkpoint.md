### **(3) Brief Project Description**  
We will be working with both datasets to identify trends within the data to help MMA fighters learn more about the statistics behind the matches. This data can help fighters improve faster while maintaining safer training methods.

**Key Questions/Inquiries**:
- Orthodox vs Southpaw vs Switch with win ratio  
- Career trajectory after fighting (if data is available, with a focus on ex-military fighters)
- Comparing 2023 data vs all-time data since 1994  
- Punches landed: Male division vs Female division  
- Success by age: Comparing fighters under 20 vs over 20
